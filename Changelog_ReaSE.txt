ReaSE v1.1 --> v1.2
-------------------

Updated TCP_hack implementation to the current version of the INET framework
(commit , 2010-03-13). In addition, some more fixes have been necessary in order
to support the current version of the INET framework.

Added collection of statistics in module TribeFloodNetwork. In addition, 
implementation of other DDoS attacks than SYN flooding has been fixed. 
Added FIN flooding attack.

Added collection of statistics in module InetUser. Bugfix in requesting
responsible connection manager.

Some small bugfixes in module ConnectionManager that mainly deal with the
situation, in which no traffic profile is selected.

Some changes eliminating warnings while compiling. In addition, necessary
changes for gcc-4.3 and gcc-4.4 have been included.

ReaSE v1.2 --> v1.21
-------------------

Fixed some bugs regarding the number of server reply packets of the automatically generated background traffic.

ReaSE v1.2 --> v1.22
-------------------

This version now can be used either in combination with OMNeT++ and INET (as before) or together with the OverSim P2P simulator for OMNeT++.

ReaSE v1.2 --> v1.23
-------------------

Since with version 1.22 something went completely wrong with building the tarball archive, I fixed these problems and named the version, which now really
works with the OverSim P2P simulator, v1.23.
