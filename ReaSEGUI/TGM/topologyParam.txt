# You can choose to generate only AS- or only router-level topology
# You can also generate AS- with router-level topology


# If you don't want AS-Level, comment the following line
<AS-Level>
# number of AS-level nodes in topology
	<AS-Nodes><5>
# which edge-degree must an AS node have to be a transit AS
	<Transit-Node-Thresh><4>
# PFP Growing Parameter
	<Parameter-P><0.4>
	<Parameter-Delta><0.048>


# If you don't want R-Level, comment the following line
<Router-Level>
# maximum number of router-level nodes in topology
	<R-Node-Max><10>
# minimum number of router-level nodes in topology
	<R-Node-Min><7>
# percentage of core nodes in topology
	<Core-Ratio><20>
# percentage of Core-Cross-Links
	<Core-Cross-Link-Ratio><40>
# maximum number of host per edge router

# miminum number of hosts per edge router
	<Hosts-Per-Edge-Min><5>
